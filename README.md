GHC Complete
============

This repository is, in a way, a meta-repository. Everytime any of the
[GHC-related repositories] is updated, this is reflected in the file
`fingerprints`. So the timeline of this repository reflects the combined
timeline of GHC development, and hence is suitable for [continous integration]
and bisecting a problem.
